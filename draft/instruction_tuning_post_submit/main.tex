\title{Analytical Characterization of Instruction-Tuning Datasets Using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Approaches}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

Here we describe our general approach to characterizing a collection of instruction-tuning examples, and apply it to the open-source Databricks Dolly2 dataset. Using an iterative process of clustering, manual examination, and semi-automated curation, we have identified subcategories of instructions at a variety of granularities. We set out to characterize instruction/response pairs on three broad dimensions: the subject domain to which the instruction pertains, the syntax of the way the instruction is phrased, and the format in which the results are requested. Careful dissection of the Dolly dataset allows us to identify hierarchical groups of instructions that can be considered similar or dissimilar in a variety of aspects. This kind of characterization is necessary to enable systematic monitoring of the performance of instruction-tuned language models on narrowly defined subsets of instruction types described by multiple aspects. Such detailed monitoring will be crucial for detecting specific weaknesses in the performance of tuned models to facilitate targeted augmentation of the training sets, or other approaches to remediation of the models.
